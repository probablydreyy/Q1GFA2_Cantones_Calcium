                <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>

                <p>
                    Naruto was unknowingly made into the host (jinchuriki) of the Nine-Tails Fox, a dangerous and powerful tailed beast that attacked the village.
                    <br>
                    Naruto has a long-standing rivalry with Sasuke Uchiha, another prominent character in the series.
                    <br>
                    Naruto is known for his cheerful, outgoing, and determined personality. He is also famous for his catchphrase, "Believe it!" (in the English dub).
                    <br>
                    Naruto's dream is to become the Hokage, the strongest ninja and leader of his village, in order to gain the recognition and respect he has always craved.
